This is my project(website) on Django. Just primitive things. I hope to do something better later, now it's time fro some practice.
I decided to do a website about my favorite characters of Warcraft? cause i'm a big fan of WoW:)
This is how my project looks in 27.06.2023

These buttons are not text anymore, these are links
Also my site now has 2 tables, second one is for hero's fraction

I decided to change main page color to black, just to understand how css works
